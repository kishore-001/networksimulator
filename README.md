# Network Simulator in Bash

This project is a simple **Network Simulator** built using Bash scripting. It simulates basic network operations such as packet transmission, device connections, and routing. The simulator is designed for learning and experimentation purposes, particularly for those interested in understanding the fundamentals of network communication in a Linux environment.

## Features

- **Packet Transmission**: Simulate sending and receiving packets between virtual devices.
- **Routing**: Configure basic routing between different virtual devices.
- **Device Simulation**: Create multiple virtual network devices for testing.
- **Network Topology**: Simulate different network topologies like bus, star, and ring.
- **Logging**: Record network traffic and routing decisions in log files for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A Linux environment
- Basic networking tools (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`)
- Bash 4.0 or later

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-simulator.git
   cd network-simulator

   ```

2. Give execute permissions to the Bash scripts:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

## To Run:

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x network_simulator.sh
   ```

2. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   ./network_simulator.sh
   ```
